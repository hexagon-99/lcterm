 5-Embrion

 ----------------------

 CONDITIONS: Desolate and flat with unbreathable air, Embrion's 
 surface layer is almost entirely made of amethyst quartz, which is 
 made possible by Embrion's distance to its nearest star and its 
 resulting geothermal activity. The surface of Embrion is scorchingly 
 hot.

 HISTORY: Embrion was discovered in just the last century. It appears 
 to have been used as a testing ground for Old Birds long before it 
 was officially discovered. As a result of this danger, its status has 
 been marked as Condemned. There are theories that a diverse 
 geothermal ecosystem may be thriving within a vast cave network under 
 Embrion's surface.

 FAUNA: Embrion is devoid of biological life.
