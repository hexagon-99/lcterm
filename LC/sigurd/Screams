date: September 13, 1968

for some reason I was the one who had to call the company number to report the 
acciddent. they were too scared to do it. It was the same fake voice I remember 
from the interview on the phone at home and the stupid training videos. but it 
heard what I said I think, cause it said they would contact the family and find 
a replacement and something e lse. It talked so fast.

I learned you can hear the screams all the time in the walkie talkie when you;re 
at the wall of the Company building. they didnt believe me, well now they do. It 
sounds just like when I heard it a couple weeks ago. They want to quit. I said 
I'm not a coward. I just got this job
