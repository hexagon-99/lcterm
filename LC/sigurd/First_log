Hello. i am writing this log to keep myself sane. I couldnt find a way to 
do the most basic thing on this old janky butt computer so I had Desmond 
add it in, the log feature. til now ive just been adding my own notes to 
the bestiary whatever i know. My brother said i should keep a journal so im 
doing what i can! I am writing in a proffessional manner, as these logs 
could become a historical record, as they will projbably be here for years, 
just as long as there isnt a clean wipe. that is what desmond saidfd

If you are reading it in the future, you are probably from a nother crew. 
The turnover rate here is enormous, maybe cause this job sucks and every 
one turns over dead! Maybe I can give some help when I have some 
expirience. End log.
Oh, our names are: Sigurd (me), Richard, Desmond, Jess.
