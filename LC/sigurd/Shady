date is August 31, 1968. I got camera duty again, I hate walking on this 
moon anyway. ahah jokes on them it, just started raining!!! Im just 
sitting. cant sleep on these tiny beds for ants

Ive been thinking a lot. I think this job is shady. If youre reading this 
you probbably got here the same as me. the pay is good, the contract only 
lasts a season. they ran you through their "assessmennt exam" on the phone 
with a weird voice. you signed the contract on the shuttle with the rest of 
your crew. But the whole time you didnt talk to anyone. The shuttle was 
autopiloted, I think the voice on the phone was fake. I;ve had the wrost 
dreams, I think I just want to go back home. but im not gonna crawl home, 
crying and scratching on dad's front door. thats not his son. thats not 
Sigurd!
