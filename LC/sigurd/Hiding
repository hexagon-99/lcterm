I keep having bad dreams about the Company building where the Company breaks out 
of that giant concrete wall. But i dont know if it looks like anything, I just 
think its really big and fast. We cant figure out a way to know if the voices on 
the phone are real, desmond says its too far away. I asked him if he could ttake 
control of the autopilot and he said im crazy and that could kill us. yes I am 
crazy desmond

he says we would have to get our own private flight to go to the cordinates, and 
who knows what would actually be there. So, what if its nothing? 
I started wondering how I cant remember how we really got here, no I just 
remember little things like the shuttle flight to the building where we signed 
our contracts. But I dont remember getting on the shuttle, I dont even remember 
saying bye to dad. in my dreams it feels like the company isnt trapped in there 
at all, its just hiding. I dont know if im going home
