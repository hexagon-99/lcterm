September 27, 1968

desmond wants me to writ e down what we figured out and keep my "nonsense to a 
minimum". So im going to put SO MUCH of my non sense. screw him. The new crew 
member is named Lucas and he is so confused and scared a ll the time, what a 
baby, at least he doesnt smell like a monster. its been so sunny even though its 
september, and these suits dont take it well

ok so desmond "traced the call" and found out theres a group of people somewhere 
else that pretends to call us from the company building. they are across the 
whole solar system !! why would they be so far away.

Desmond says he doesnt know, but I think. What if there really is a big monster 
in the company building like the voice told me on the wlakie talkie? They 
trapped it, and we feed it to keep it tame. I just wanted a stupid job!!!!!
