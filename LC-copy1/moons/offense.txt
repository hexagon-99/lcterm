 21-Offense

 ----------------------

 CONDITIONS: Believed to have splintered off from its cousin 
 Assurance, Offense features similar jagged and dry conditions but 
 differs in its ecosystem.

 HISTORY: 21-Offense is categorized as an asteroid moon and seems 
 to have not existed on its own for more than several hundred 
 years. The industrial artifacts here have suffered damage; it's 
 believed they were built long before 21-Offense was splintered off. 

 FAUNA: A competitive and toughened ecosystem supports aggressive 
 lifeforms. Travellers to 21-Offense should know it's not for the 
 faint of heart.
