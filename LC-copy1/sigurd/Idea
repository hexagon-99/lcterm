the past weekend it feels like Desmond and Jess woke up. we;re supposed to get 
our fourth member of the crew in a few days. We arent taking any risks anymore, 
we dont get as much but it feels safer, and ive gotten better sleep. but its 
still ass. I can still smell Rich I swear to gosh he smelled that bad

I was talking about how the voice on the phone sounded fake. Then Desmond got 
this weird idea. he's the wizard and all so he thinks theres a way to use the 
phone call I made to the company number to find ourt where the voice comes from. 
I dont know why hed want to do that but he seems serious. He;s been using the 
terminal a lot.
