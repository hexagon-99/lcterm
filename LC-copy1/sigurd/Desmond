 Desmond. October 15, 1968. I am encrypting these logs to keep 
 them hidden, as I fear the system will be wiped if they are 
 found. It's all a guise. We're supposed to think it's all just a 
 transaction, but our real job is keeping an incredible terror fed. 
 How long until its fullness ends and its hunger is insatiable? God 
 knows, maybe it has to do with all these desolate moons. Whoever 
 reads this, I am sorry to burden you with this. 
 Please have a good day and night--as what else is there for us 
 to do?
