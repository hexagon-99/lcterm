I got woken up early this morning because we were going to the company building 
to sell our useless garbage. The rate was 120% which Desmond says is rare and he 
didnt want to miss it, hes been watching it like the stupid stocks.

it still sucks here, Rich still smells like a piece of hsit .I can barely sleep. 
I heard the wrorst sound behind the wall of the company building, it sounded 
like crying red faces all churned up and swept away by concrete, like the pestle 
and bowl my mom crushes up her seeds and spices in. I still hear it. Its a 
nightmare. no one else heard it. they dont know what to do. Jess thinks i;m 
"home sick," no im sick of this cheap suit
