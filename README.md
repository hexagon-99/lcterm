# lcterm

A recreation of the lethal company terminal, with a few additional features. 

## Installation

1. Download
2. Unzip
3. $ cd ./LC
3. $ ./lcterm.sh

## Notes: 

- This project is primarily a way for me to get better at writing bash, so it is a bit jank. 
- It *should* run indenepdant of directory as long as all the files are located in the same directory. 
- It looks really cool if your using cool retro term. If you are, I would suggest running it with the 'r' flag, it changes the text colour to be more visible.
